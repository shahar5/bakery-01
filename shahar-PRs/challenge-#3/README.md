- Make sure you have a Jenkins container as a service, so it will be persistent over your Linux VM restarts.
- In this VM, there must be a script that runs and configures Jenkins properly:
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Relevant plugins (Git, Github, Pipeline)
  - Github access
  - Python (pipenv)
  - Skips Setup Wizard (the initial admin dialog, etc.)
  - One pipeline job that runs by request:
    - Takes a Jenkinsfile from a repo
    - Completes successfully
