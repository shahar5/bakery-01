- Please create a docker-compose.yml that will deploy flask application with postgres as his DB.
- Few notes:
  - Use depends_on.
  - Populate all relevant properties using environment variables.
  - Both of the containers will be deployed on a custom network named ‘bakery’.
  - Use local volumes for The webapp and the DB.
  - Create another shared volume and make sure that both of the containers can read and write to it.
